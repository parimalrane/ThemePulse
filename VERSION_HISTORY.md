## PROJECT DESCRIPTION

ThemePulse is a proprietary institutional capital rotation research engine.

Primary Objective:

Identify where institutional money is flowing across market themes and sectors.

Core Philosophy:

Trade LONG where institutional capital is flowing.

Trade SHORT where institutional capital is leaving.

Final trading decisions are based on manual chart review and technical analysis.

---

## CORE DESIGN PHILOSOPHY

Primary Principle:

Institutional Narrative > Traditional Sector Classification

Key Insight Learned During Development:

Traditional sector classification frequently fails to capture real institutional positioning.

Example:

A company classified under Technology sector may actually belong to:

AI Infrastructure

Optical Networking

Semiconductor Equipment

Cloud Infrastructure

Defense AI

Institutional narrative matters more than textbook sector labels.

---

---

## IMPORTANT ARCHITECTURE DECISIONS

Decision 1

Do not rely purely on Industry and Sector columns.

Decision 2

Institutional Narrative mapping is more important than sector classification.

Decision 3

Unknown theme stocks should NOT be automatically discarded.

Decision 4

Strong unknown stocks can be classified as:

Unclassified Leader

Decision 5

Short candidates should detect institutional capital exit, not simply weak companies.

Decision 6

Broad market stock mapping coverage is more important than perfect mapping accuracy.

Decision 7

Production stability is more important than adding continuous new features.

---

## CURRENT LIMITATIONS

Some stocks remain difficult to classify.

Examples:

GM

HON

BAH

PCAR

LI

Breadth engine can produce misleading output for themes with very few stocks.

Example:

1 stock out of 1 stock = 100% breadth.

ETF universe still includes geographic ETF themes.

Examples:

South Korea

Taiwan

Peru

Chile

Poland

VERSION 1.1 — ETF Pipeline Restoration

Major Fixes

• Restored ETF.csv as active input source

Results

• Market rotation now reflects US institutional sector rotation
• Theme classification significantly improved
• Long watchlist quality improved substantially

Pending Issues

• Breadth engine redesign

ETF DISCOVERY ENGINE

Purpose

Tabela currently uses a manually curated Allowed ETF universe.

Risk

New institutional themes may emerge which are not currently tracked.

Example

Artificial Intelligence
Quantum Computing
Nuclear Energy
Robotics Automation
Defense AI
Space Infrastructure

Future Solution

Build ETF Discovery Engine.

Workflow

1. Scan complete ETF.csv universe daily

2. Exclude currently approved Allowed ETFs

3. Identify strongest untracked ETFs using:

   • ETF RS Rating
   • 3 Month Performance
   • Relative Volume / AUM (future)

4. Generate Candidate ETF Report

5. Manual approval required before adding new ETF to allowed_etfs.py

Principle

Tabela should detect emerging institutional themes automatically but should never auto-add ETFs without manual review.
