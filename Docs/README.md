# TABELA — Market Theme Rotation Scanner

**Version 3.1** | Production-Ready Research Tool

TABELA is an intelligent market scanning system that identifies attractive long and short stock opportunities by analyzing **institutional capital flows through ETF theme rotation** combined with multi-factor stock-level scoring.

## Core Concept

Traditional stock analysis classifies companies by sector (e.g., "semiconductors"). TABELA takes a different approach: it classifies stocks by the **current institutional narrative** (e.g., META as "AI Platform" rather than "social media"). By tracking which themes attract institutional capital through ETF inflows, TABELA dynamically detects emerging market opportunities and fading trends.

## What It Does

### Quick Summary
1. **Analyzes 2,500+ filtered ETFs** to identify the strongest market themes
2. **Maps 5,000+ stocks** to institutional narratives driving capital flows
3. **Scores stocks** using 5 factors: momentum, theme strength, sales growth, analyst ratings, and profitability
4. **Generates watchlists** with top 40 long candidates and top 20 short candidates
5. **Tracks rotation** by comparing daily theme classifications to detect shifts in institutional focus

### Detailed Workflow

```
INPUT: stocks.csv + ETF.csv (daily market data)
          ↓
    [Step 1] ETF PROCESSING
       • Filter 5,000+ ETFs → 2,500 equity themes
       • Calculate ETF momentum (relative strength)
       • Assign theme classifications
          ↓
    [Step 2] THEME RANKING
       • Classify themes: Leading (↑), Emerging (↑↑), Weakening (↓), Lagging (↓↓)
       • Rank by institutional strength
          ↓
    [Step 3] STOCK-TO-THEME MAPPING
       • Priority 1: Manual institutional narratives (100+ expert-curated mappings)
       • Priority 2: Automated sector/industry detection
       • Priority 3: Narrative translation to ETF themes
          ↓
    [Step 4] MULTI-FACTOR SCORING
       • Relative Strength (momentum): 40%
       • Theme Strength: 25%
       • Sales Growth: 20%
       • Zacks Rating: 10%
       • Profitability: 5%
       • Result: Composite score (0-100)
          ↓
    [Step 5] WATCHLIST GENERATION
       • Long candidates: Strong themes + high scores
       • Short candidates: Weak themes + poor momentum
       • Institutional leaders: Top 20 from leading themes
          ↓
    OUTPUT: Market rotation report + daily JSON snapshot

## Key Features

| Feature | Benefit |
|---------|---------|
| **Dynamic Theme Discovery** | Automatically adapts to new market narratives (no manual ETF curation required) |
| **Institutional Flow Tracking** | Identifies where smart money is flowing through ETF inflows |
| **Multi-Factor Scoring** | Balances momentum, fundamentals, and theme strength for quality candidates |
| **Daily Snapshots** | Builds historical database for rotation analysis and trend detection |
| **Expert Overrides** | ~100+ manual narrative mappings reflect real institutional thinking (e.g., NVDA = "AI Accelerators") |
| **Theme Breadth Analysis** | Shows % of strong stocks per theme (leading themes have broader participation) |

---

## Example Institutional Narratives

The system recognizes that institutional investors think in narratives, not sectors:

| Stock | Institutional Narrative | Traditional Sector |
|-------|------------------------|-------------------|
| NVDA | AI Accelerators | Semiconductors |
| META | AI Platform | Social Media |
| TSLA | Autonomous Driving AI | Automobiles |
| PLTR | Defense Software | Enterprise Software |
| RKLB | Space Infrastructure | Aerospace |
| SNOW | Cloud Infrastructure | Data Warehouse |
| RIOT | Digital Assets Infrastructure | Tech Hardware |

This approach captures **where institutional capital is flowing**, not static business categories.

## Understanding the Asterisk (*)

In the watchlist output, asterisks indicate stocks selected **primarily through institutional narrative strength**:

- **With \*:** Stock appeared in long watchlist because its theme is strong (institutional capital flowing in), even if individual fundamentals are moderate
- **Without \*:** Stock scored high on composite factors; theme strength was supporting factor

**Interpretation:** \* signals pure institutional conviction plays; non-\* signals balanced opportunities.

---

## Use Cases

### Portfolio Managers
Identify emerging themes gaining institutional capital flows for thematic portfolio construction.

### Traders
Detect theme rotation turning points and capitalize on breadth shifts.

### Researchers
Analyze historical theme performance through daily snapshots and rotation deltas.

### Analysts
Find stocks aligned with institutional narratives before broader market recognition.

## Important Notes

- **Research Tool, Not Trading Signal** — TABELA identifies opportunities for analysis; not a trading system
- **Daily Updates Required** — Requires fresh stocks.csv and ETF.csv files from Zacks daily
- **No Real-Time Feed** — Uses static daily exports; not suitable for intraday trading
- **Prototype Status** — ~90% complete; gaps include real-time data integration and enhanced error handling
- **Research Grade** — Designed for professional investors and researchers
