Current production architecture.

---

## VERSION 3.1 (ETF FILTER ENGINE REFINEMENT)

New ETF filtering architecture implemented.

Automatic exclusions:

Status:

Stable.

==================================================
CURRENT PRODUCTION VERSION
==========================

Current version:

ThemePulse Version 3.1

Architecture status:

Stable production architecture.

Estimated completion:

90%

==================================================
CURRENT SYSTEM STABILITY STATUS
===============================

Stable components:

ETF Architecture → Stable

ETF Filter Engine → Stable

Theme Rotation Engine → Stable

Long Candidate Engine → Stable

Composite Scoring Engine → Stable

Needs improvement:

Stock taxonomy coverage → Partial

Rotation historical intelligence → Missing

Historical logging → Missing

==================================================
FUTURE ROADMAP (REVISED)
========================

Priority order re-evaluated.

Only high-value enhancements remain.

---

P0 — LONG ENGINE VALIDATION (HIGHEST PRIORITY)

Reason:

ETF architecture changed significantly.

Old system:

20 ETF themes

New system:

2500+ filtered ETFs

Need validation:

Are highest ranked long candidates truly strongest market leaders?

Audit required.

Test against known leaders.

Examples:

* NVDA
* AVGO
* CRDO
* ALAB
* PLTR
* GOOG
* META
* ARM
* MU
* AMD
* TSM

Questions:

* Are top 40 longs correct?
* Are strongest leaders missing?
* Does theme scoring have excessive influence?

Purpose:

Validate long engine after ETF architecture upgrade.

Status:

Next highest priority.

---

P1 — HISTORICAL SNAPSHOT ENGINE

Old idea rejected:

No separate weekly or monthly logs required.

New architecture:

Store one snapshot every run.

Create:

history/

Each run automatically generates:

YYYY-MM-DD.json

Example:

history/

2026-06-18.json

2026-06-19.json

2026-06-20.json

Each snapshot stores:

* Leading themes
* Emerging themes
* Weakening themes
* Lagging themes
* Top long candidates
* Top short candidates

Purpose:

Permanent institutional market history database.

Status:

High priority.

---

P2 — ROTATION DELTA ENGINE

Purpose:

Compare current market structure with historical snapshots.

Example:

Software

Leading → Weakening

Biotech

Lagging → Emerging

Semiconductors

Leading → Emerging

Detect:

Institutional accumulation.

Institutional distribution.

Theme leadership rotation.

Potential file:

rotation_delta.py

Purpose:

Largest future edge in ThemePulse.

Status:

High priority.

---

P3 — STOCK TAXONOMY EXPANSION

Problem:

Still too many unknown stocks.

Examples:

* NKE
* CAG
* WHR
* PLAY
* KHC
* KMB
* DEO
* WBD

Current impact:

Mostly affects short candidate engine.

Target:

Unknown stocks < 5%

Approach:

Gradual maintenance.

No urgent redesign required.

Status:

Medium priority.

---

LOW PRIORITY / DEFERRED ITEMS

Currently NOT required.

Removed from roadmap:

* Weekly maintenance workflow
* Monthly maintenance workflow
* Weekly log generation
* Monthly log generation
* Separate short engine redesign
* Theme normalization engine

Reason:

System architecture now largely self-adaptive.

==================================================
ENGINEERING PRINCIPLES (UPDATED)
================================

Priority order:

1. Capital rotation detection

2. Long candidate quality

3. Historical institutional intelligence

4. Rotation detection over time

5. Stock classification refinement

6. Short candidate refinement

Rules:

Do not redesign stable architecture.

Do not over-engineer logging.

Avoid unnecessary maintenance burden.

System should adapt automatically to future market narratives.

Theme detection is primary.

Stock selection is secondary.

==================================================
TARGET END STATE
================

ThemePulse becomes:

Institutional Capital Rotation Intelligence Engine

Capabilities:

* Detect strongest themes
* Detect weakest themes
* Detect theme rotation early
* Build historical institutional database
* Adapt automatically to future narratives
* Generate best long candidates
* Generate weak short candidates

Final architecture target:

Production-grade market intelligence engine.



# CORE STOCK SELECTION PHILOSOPHY

ThemePulse prioritizes accelerating institutional leaders rather than established market leaders.

ThemePulse does NOT attempt to identify the best company.

ThemePulse attempts to identify where institutional capital is rotating most aggressively right now.

Examples:

MU may rank above NVDA.

CRDO may rank above AVGO.

ALAB may rank above META.

This is expected behavior.

Priority:

Recent acceleration > established leadership

Swing trading opportunity > long-term company quality
