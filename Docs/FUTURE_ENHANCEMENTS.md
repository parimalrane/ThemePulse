# TABELA FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS

## CORE IDENTITY

TABELA is an Institutional Capital Rotation Intelligence Engine.

TABELA is NOT a stock scanner.

TABELA does NOT generate trade signals.

Primary objectives:

* Detect institutional capital accumulation

* Build proprietary historical market intelligence database
* Learn recurring institutional behavior before future market leaders emerge

Core philosophy:

Capital Flow Detection First
Stock Selection Second
Historical Intelligence Compounds Over Time
Chart Review Always Mandatory
TABELA Surfaces Opportunity — Human Executes Decision

# ADDITIONAL FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS (POST ANOMALY ENGINE REVIEW)

## LESSONS LEARNED — ANOMALY ENGINE V1 EXPERIMENT

Behavioral Anomaly Engine V1 experiment was intentionally paused.

Key learning:

Single day snapshot data from ETF.csv and stocks.csv is insufficient for reliable anomaly detection.

Attempting anomaly detection using only present-day weakness created low quality outputs.

Conclusion:

Do not force advanced market behavior detection on insufficient data.

Future anomaly intelligence should only be built when sufficient historical data exists.

Status:

ON HOLD

---

## P14 — BEHAVIORAL ANOMALY ENGINE V2

Goal:

Detect unusual behavior in institutionally relevant stocks.

Important rule:

Do NOT scan entire stock universe.

Focus only on historically important stocks.

Possible anomaly signals:

* Leadership deterioration
* Relative strength decay
* Composite score deterioration
* Sudden exit from leadership universe
* Internal theme divergence

Data dependency:

Requires minimum 5–10 days historical stock snapshots.

Priority:

HIGH (Future)

Status:

WAITING FOR SUFFICIENT HISTORY

---

## P15 — LEADERSHIP DETERIORATION ENGINE

Goal:

Detect strong stocks beginning to lose leadership characteristics.

Example:

Composite score deterioration across multiple sessions.

Example pattern:

95 → 89 → 81 → 72 → 61

Signals:

* Institutional distribution
* Failed breakout
* Momentum exhaustion
* Leadership weakening

Output example:

HIGH ATTENTION WATCHLIST

Purpose:

Surface high quality stocks requiring immediate chart review.

Priority:

VERY HIGH

---

## P16 — RELATIVE STRENGTH DECAY ENGINE

Goal:

Track gradual deterioration in relative strength over multiple sessions.

Example:

RS Rating

96 → 91 → 83 → 74 → 66

Purpose:

Detect weakening momentum before market consensus recognizes weakness.

Signals:

* Early distribution
* Capital rotation
* Institutional exit behavior

Priority:

VERY HIGH

---

## P17 — LEADER EXIT DETECTION ENGINE

Goal:

Track stocks repeatedly appearing in Institutional Leaders universe.

Detect sudden disappearance.

Example:

PLTR appears in leadership universe for 7 consecutive sessions.

Day 8 disappears.

Possible interpretation:

* Distribution
* Failed breakout
* Leadership transfer
* Temporary weakness

Purpose:

Identify important stocks changing character.

Priority:

EXTREMELY HIGH

---

## P18 — INTERNAL THEME DIVERGENCE ENGINE

Goal:

Detect divergence inside strong themes.

Example:

Semiconductors remains leading theme.

NVDA stable.

MU stable.

AMD weakening consistently.

Possible interpretation:

Institutional rotation happening inside theme.

Purpose:

Detect non-consensus internal capital movement.

Priority:

HIGH

---

## PERMANENT ARCHITECTURE RULE

Do not force advanced intelligence layers on insufficient data.

Single day snapshot data supports:

* Capital flow detection
* Theme rotation detection
* Institutional leader detection
* Weakness detection

Single day snapshot data does NOT reliably support:

* Behavioral anomaly detection
* Distribution detection
* Leadership deterioration detection
* Character change detection

Advanced intelligence layers must be supported by sufficient historical data.

Architecture principle:

Data capability defines intelligence capability.

Never force philosophy beyond available data.



FUTURE ENHANCEMENT

Purpose:

Track 5–10 day history.

Detect stocks previously appearing in Long Watchlist.

Flag if:

• RS deteriorates sharply
• Theme deteriorates
• Leadership disappears suddenly

Goal:

Identify abnormal institutional distribution behavior.

Example target:

PLTR style breakdown candidates.
