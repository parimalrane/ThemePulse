===========================================================
PROJECT PHILOSOPHY
===========================================================

Core Principle:

Institutional Narrative > Traditional Sector Classification


Price action reveals institutional behavior before classification systems catch up.


===========================================================
REFERENCE PHILOSOPHY
===========================================================

Inspired by:

- DeepVue
- IBD / MarketSurge
- Theme Rotation Investing
- Institutional Growth Investing


===========================================================
IMPORTANT RULE
===========================================================

Do NOT continuously change stable architecture.

New features must be validated against real market behavior.

Production stability is more important than feature expansion.
